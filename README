Program for interfacing instruments/sensors producing analog voltages to the 
FAAM aircraft data acqusition system: DECADES.

Program is intended to be loaded onto an Arduino UNO or Arduino UNO-PRO 
(see http://www.hobbytronics.co.uk/arduino-uno-pro) with Arduino Ethernet-Shield
attached.

The program will log the difference between Analog input pins A0 and A1. 
The data is recorded at 1Hz and stored to a csv file on the on board SD card. 
The data is streamed to two TCP/IP servers in binary format.
The data is streamed over UDP/IP using a multicast address.
Timing synchronisation is provided by frequent checks to an NTP server.
The addresses of the TCP/IP servers, UDP/IP multicast, NTP server, local 
Arduino IP address are setup using the zeusCon.cfg file found on the SD card. If
the SD card is not present, then these options are set to thosed hardcoded in 
this program.

Data is also streamed over a serial terminal, along with useful debug 
information.

Further features are described in specific version READMEs.
